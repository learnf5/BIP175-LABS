# Your Lab Guide is Here!

## Overview

In this series of labs you will practice securing a vulnerable web application deployed in BIG-IP Next.
After quickly adding and licensing an instance of BIG-IP Next to your Central Manager,
you will create a standard application containing a virtual server, pool, and pool member.
 
You will first exploit a web application vulnerability to demonstrate pre-protection behavior, and then dive into four common scenarios
for securing applications using BIG-IP Next Web Application Firewall (WAF): Protecting against commmon threats such as code injection, handling malicious bot traffic, securing a login page from brute force attacks, and preventing
information leakage in HTTP responses.
 
You will demonstrate that the web application is protected, explore attack data in the WAF dashboard and event log, and review policy protection settings.
