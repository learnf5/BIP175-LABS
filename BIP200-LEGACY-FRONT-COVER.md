## Lab Overview

In this lesson, like the previous lesson, you will use the prebuilt Central Manager and VE Instance that are *native* to the Skillable lab environment.

The first three labs in this lesson retrace the steps from the previous two lessons.  The final lab introduces the concept of migrating an application from older versions of BIG-IP that predate BIG-IP Next.  You will first create an app on BIG-IP 17.1, save configuration, using the saved configuration import the app into BIG-IP Next 20.2 and finally test the app on BIG-IP Next.
