# Your Lab Guide is Here!

## Lab Overview

In this lab, like the previous lab, you will use the prebuilt Central Manager and VE Instance that are *native* to the Skillable lab environment.

The first three exercises in this lab retrace the steps from the previous two labs.  The final exercise introduces the concept of migrating an application from older versions of BIG-IP that predate BIG-IP Next.  You will first create an app on BIG-IP 17.1, save the configuration, using the saved configuration import the app into BIG-IP Next 20.2 and finally test the app on BIG-IP Next.
